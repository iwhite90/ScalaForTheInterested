# Chapter 1

Welcome paragraph. Why did I write this book. Scala as a good initial language to learn, but most books and tutorials on it assume you're already a good programmer. Also wanted to go beyond what a lot of beginner's books cover, and teach good professional practices from the start, such as how to effectively test code and write it in a maintainable way.

#### Why Scala

#### Who this book is for

This is a book for beginners. I'm going to assume that you know absolutely nothing about coding. However, you will need to have some level of confidence using computers, mainly to get everything set up. We'll be installing programs from the internet, using the command line, and possibly configuring environment variables on your computer. Because every computer is different, and things change rapidly in the world of software development, you may find that the steps I describe to get set up don't quite work for you, so you may need to search for solutions. I'll try to point you in the right direction wherever I can.

This is not a Scala book. It is a book about programming, that happens to use Scala. Scala is a very powerful and feature-rich programming language, and trying to cover all of the features would distract from the basics that I'm trying to focus on. There are plenty of good books and resources to comprehensively learn Scala, but they tend to assume that the reader has some pre-existing knowledge of programming. Once you finish this book you'll have that knowledge, and I'll point you to some of these Scala resources at the end of the book.

It will give you enough broad knowledge of the fundamentals for you to read and write basic programs. We'll dip into some important concepts in coding, such as Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and Test Driven Development. These are huge subject areas in themselves, so for the sake of keeping this book focussed we'll be leaving out quite a lot. However, if this book whets your appetite for more, then you'll be in a position to pick up more advanced programming books and understand what they're talking about.

This book is not going to teach you how to write a website, or a mobile app, or a 3D game. Most real world programming takes place within an ecosystem of technologies and concepts. Website development requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks, HTTP; mobile apps need understanding of IOS and Android operating systems; and to write a 3D game you'd probably use a game engine such as Unity, along with sprites, annimations and sound effects. The beating heart of each of these ecosystems is the same though - coding.

I see this very much as a *gateway to coding* book. The fundamental concepts that you'll learn throughout this book are found in many other programming languages. Once you've finished you'll be all set to continue your coding journey. Perhaps you'll use the Play framework to create dynamic websites using Scala. Maybe you'll look into Swift and create an app for the Apple App Store. How about some C# for a retro 2D platform game? Or Python for data analytics? All you need is a computer, and the possibilities are limited just by your imagination.

#### How to read this book

This book is designed to be read in order. It starts by getting your computer set up for coding, then leads you through from very basic concepts to putting together a complex program at the end. Later chapters build on earlier ones, so if you jump about through the book you may find things that you don't understand.

There are plenty of code examples throughout the book, and each chapter will tend to build up a large example from several smaller ones. If you just have a general interest in learning what coding is about, feel free to read through the book without trying any of the examples. However, if you want to be able to write code, then I strongly advise you to follow along with the examples, and actually write and run the code. The best way of learning is to experiment, so write the code as it appears in the book, then try making changes to it and see what happens. If you can, think up your own programs using the concepts you've learnt so far and try writing them from scratch.
